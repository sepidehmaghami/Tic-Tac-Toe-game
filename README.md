Tic Tac Toe game with python

# Project Description
In this project, I have created a Tic Tac Toe game with python. This game is a two-player game. 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
One player plays with X and the other player plays with O. 
The players take turns to play. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
